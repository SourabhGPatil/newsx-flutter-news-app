# News-X

News-X is a mobile application crafted using Dart language and Flutter SDK, leveraging the capabilities of the NewsAPI.

## Overview

This project presents three distinct viewing pages designed to facilitate the seamless consumption of news stories within the community. These pages include the homepage, an article viewing page, and a category-oriented news viewing page. Together, they form a foundational application that empowers users to stay informed about global stories efficiently. Built with Flutter SDK and Dart, the application's logic is adaptable to both major mobile platformsâ€”Android and iOS. Integration with Google Firebase enhances the user experience through analytics and push notification services.

Traditional native news apps often incur high development and maintenance costs. Major publishers like BBC News or The New York Times manage articles with in-house writers, leaving many local newspapers resource-strapped. The Android structure, with its robust frameworks, libraries, and APIs, provides a powerful foundation, enabling us to deliver an enhanced user experience.

In summary, this project encompasses three view pages equipped with functionalities and modules to create a user-friendly, resource-efficient application. This ensures consistent compatibility across a diverse range of mobile devices.
