# News-X
A News mobile application built with Dart language and Flutter SDK, by using the NewsAPI.

# Overview
Our project revolves around the development of a dynamic application designed to revolutionize the consumption of NEWS stories within communities. Comprising three distinct viewing style pages—namely, the homepage, article viewing page, and a category-oriented news viewing page—the application offers a seamless and swift experience for users seeking to stay informed about global events.

Built on the Flutter SDK and utilizing Dart as its programming language, the application is a versatile solution accessible on both Android and iOS platforms. The integration of Google Firebase enhances the user experience by providing analytics and push notification services.

In contrast to the high costs associated with developing and maintaining native news apps, our solution leverages the power of frameworks, libraries, and APIs within the Android structure. This approach ensures a superior user experience without compromising on functionality.

Notably, the project addresses the challenge faced by local newspapers with limited resources by offering a robust platform that supports various functionalities. The three view pages are strategically designed to create a user-friendly and resource-efficient application. This ensures consistent compatibility across a diverse range of mobile devices, catering to a large and varied user base. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive yet accessible tool for users to stay informed about the world's stories, irrespective of their choice of mobile device.
