# News-X
A News mobile application built with Dart language and Flutter SDK, by using the NewsAPI.

# Overview
The project consists of three viewing style pages which aid the community to consume
NEWS stories in a rather swift manner. The three pages being homepage, article viewing page
and a category-oriented news viewing page. These all pages contribute towards the formation
of a basic application which is powerful enough to educate any user in the particular interest of
stories of the world. The application uses Flutter SDK and Dart as its programming language
and all the logic comprised can be used in both the famous mobile serviced platform that are
Android and IOS. The app is connected to google firebase which services the user analytics
and push notification services.
Native news apps are costly to develop and maintain. Native publishers, such as BBC News
orthe New York Times, handle articles and manage it with their own writers. As a result, many
local newspapers are split, resulting in a shortage of resources on one side. With frameworks,
libraries, and APIs, the Android structure provides a lot of power, allowing us to provide a
better user experience.
To encapsulate, the project contains three view pages distributed with functionalities and
modules that support a user friendly and less resource consuming application so that the
compatibility of the application over a large number of people still remain the same regardless
of the variant of mobile device being used.
